## Authentication

- To access `dxpr/dxpr_builder` packages, you need to to have an active subscription at DXPR.com. You can find your token here: https://app.sooperthemes.com/download/all#composer. This token is unique to your DXPR.com account and should be kept secret, like a password. *@todo change url to dxpr.com after site launch*

- Make sure composer is at version 1.10 or higher

- Configure the access token:

```bash
$ composer config --global bearer.packages.dxpr.com <access_token>
```

## Composer build

```bash
$ composer clearcache
$ composer create-project dxpr/lightning-dxpr-project EXAMPLE_DIRECTORY
```

## Troubleshooting

### *Killed* message or *Memory* related message

* Composer installation requires a lot of resources, try (temporarily) upgrading your cloud or VPS machine to at least **4GB** of memory and **4 vcpu**. The more the merrier.
* Make sure your PHP memory limit is set to "-1" during installation. Documentation: https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#memory-limit-errors

### The requested PHP extension *curl* is missing from your system

If composer reports *curl* or some other PHP extension is missing you have to install this extension. On Ubuntu or Debian you can fix this with a single command:

```bash
$ install apt-get install php7.4-mbstring
```

Replace 7.4 with the PHP branch you are using.
